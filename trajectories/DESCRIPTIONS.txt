The following are brief descriptions of the trajectories contatined in the packages by default.
These trajectories are generated using a matlab script and need a specific format to function.

Each row contatins a time stamp, incremented by 0.01 seconds as this is the length of time between each goal coordinate update in the offboard_ctrl scripts.

Each row has a position in R^3 (x,y,z). REMEMBER: PX4 uses a FRD frame configuration, so all z values will be negative.
Each row has a quaternion (w,i,j,k).

TEST ALL TRAJECTORIES IN SIMULATION FIRST. UNEXPECTED ERRORS WILL HAPPEN.

ANY FILE BEGINNING WITH "OMNI" IS INTENDED ONLY FOR THE OMNICOPTER.
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FLY THOSE TRAJECTORIES ON ANYTHING BUT THE OMNICOPTER.

ANY FILE BEGINNING WITH "HEX" IS INTENDED FOR THE FULLY ACTUATED HEXAROTOR.

1m_Circle_0Yaw: Ascends to 0.8m above ground, translates backwards to (-1, 0), moves in a circle centered at the origin. Maintains yaw throuought.

OMNI_1m_Circle_Rotation: Omnicopter ascends to 0.8m, translates to (-1, 0), moves in a circle centered at the origin while rotating about an axis perpendicular to the circle.

OMNI_Hover_Circle_Rotation: Omnicopter ascends to 0.8m, rotates according to the same rotation as in OMNI_1m_Circle_Rotation but without translating.

OMNI_Hover_Rotate_360: Omnicopter ascends to 0.8m, rotates about each axis by 360 degrees individually.

OMNI_Hover_Rotate_2_Axes: Omnicopter ascends to 0.8m, rotates about an off-axis. Inteded to rotate the omnicopter over its corner.

OMNI_L_Shaped_Inspection: Omnicopter flys in a trajectory shaped like: _|
